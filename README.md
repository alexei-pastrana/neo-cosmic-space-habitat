## About

Created for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** - "Your Home in Space: The Habitat Design Challenge"

This tool helps students, engineers, and space enthusiasts design functional space habitats by considering:
- Crew size and mission duration
- Destination gravity (Moon, Mars, or orbit)
- Volume and surface area calculations
- NASA zoning best practices
- Ergonomics and human factors

## How to use

1. **Select habitat shape** (cylinder, sphere, or cube)
2. **Set dimensions** (width, height, depth)
3. **Configure mission parameters** (crew size, duration, destination)
4. **Add functional areas** with appropriate percentages
5. **Place objects** like beds, equipment, and workstations
6. **Rotate and zoom** the 3D view to inspect your design
7. **Export your design** for later use

## Technologies

- **Three.js** - 3D graphics rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks needed
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Modern web standards
- **Netlify** - Deployment and hosting
